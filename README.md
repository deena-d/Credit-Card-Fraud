Step 1 - Collect data

It is to collect the dataset. dataset can be in the form of a **csv** file.Dataset can be taken from the very large dataset community kaggle website .

Step 2 - Data PreProcessing

In the data prepreocessing they can unbalance data in the data. Some details in the set are unknow data and missing data. In this set we can process all the day and make them easy to analysis for further use.

Step 3 - Data Analysis

We'll find various features in the dataset and relationship between the various dataset are found

Step 4 - Test and Train 

The test and train split refers to dividing a dataset into two separate sets: the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. It is important to ensure that the two sets are independent and representative of the overall dataset to obtain accurate and reliable results.

Step 5 - Logistic Regression Model

Logistic Regression Model is used to predict binary outcomes by estimating the probability of an event occurring based on input variables. The model applies the logistic function to map inputs to a range of 0 to 1, making it suitable for classification tasks.


Step 6 - Evalution
